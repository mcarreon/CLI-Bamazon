This is a CLI app I created using node.js, javascript, and mySql. It has two main options to be run under, customer view and manager view. The third view is still under construction: Supervisor View. Supervisor view will add the ability to view overall product sales, as well as create new departments.

## Customer View

Customer view allows the user to view items currently on sale. Once the items are displayed, the user can then purchase an item if it is in stock.

Here is a gif of it in action:

## Manager View

Manager view allows the user to view current items being sold, view items with low inventory, add stock to current items in the inventory, and add new items to the overall inventory.
